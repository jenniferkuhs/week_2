<h2 class="section3">Personal Life & Hobbies</h2>
	<p class="section3">In my free time, I enjoy spending time with my husband, Danny, our dog, Lenox, and our cat, Lanier.</br>We live in Cumming, GA. Some of our hobbies include cooking, golfing, and spending time boating </br>and jetskiing on Lake Lanier. We have a large extended family, and relish the fact that they all live close</br>enough that we get a chance to spoil our three nieces and two nephews on a regular basis!</br></br><a href="https://www.facebook.com/jenkuhs" target="_blank">
